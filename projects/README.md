# Decision services files

This directory contains sample decision services in compressed files available. You import these files into Decision Designer, which points directly to this directory (see [Importing decision projects](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYHZ8_21.0.x/com.ibm.dba.aid/topics/tsk_import_projects.html)).

The Training zip files contains five decision services to learn about the main concepts with variable difficulty models. Those concepts are
 `Business rules`, `Data management`, `Decision diagram`, `Decision tables` and `Rules policies`.
